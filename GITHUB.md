# Project Setup, Build, and Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to configure, build, and deploy the project to GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes installed with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Configuration

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   cd yourrepository
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. If you haven't already, set up GitHub Pages for your project:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to Settings > Pages
   - Select the branch you want to deploy from (usually `gh-pages` or `main/master`)
   - Click Save

## Build

To build the project, run the following command:
```bash
npm run build
```
This command creates a `build` directory with a production build of your app.

## Deployment

1. Ensure you have a `deploy` script in your `package.json`:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
   }
   ```

2. Deploy your project to GitHub Pages:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

After deploying, your project should be live on `https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepository/`.

## Conclusion

You have now successfully set up, built, and deployed your project to GitHub Pages. For more information on custom configurations and advanced usage, refer to the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).
